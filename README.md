Welcome to Hangar's GitHub!
Add anything you think will be useful to our use of GitHub to this document.

The way I have set us up is as follows:

Everyone has their own branch plus there is one "master" branch

On your local machine you will add/commit/push/pull to your own branch

On GitHub you will then make a "Pull Request" from your branch to the master branch

This code can then be accepted and merged into the project

The master branch should replicate what is on our remote server

No code should ever be pushed to the remote server from your own branch, only the master branch


Commit message format should be as follows:
Update/Add/Delete -  Filename Message
